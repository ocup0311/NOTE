> A little thought:

> "Why don't we make [#NFT] + [#LikeCoin] ?"
>
> By now, the value of NFT is only we like it & expect it'll be raised in price.
>
> Why don't we put a REAL VALUE on it?
>
> Let it value by [#Audience] & also FEEDBACK to [#Creator].

> More detail like this:

> A platform to present REAL-VALUABLE [#NFT].

> #Audience can FEEDBACK to the NFT.

> And I prefer the detail declared by [#Creator] when the NFT's created.
