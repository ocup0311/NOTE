> I think more things will get the solution by Block Chain~

> As mentioned above

> I think that's more like UX area in book, but by that I learned what key point designer care about & some methods to work through all the departments.

> #JavaScript #sort #V8

> Before, for efficacy use Insertion Sort when length < 10 & Quick Sort when > 10.
> Let the result go unstable when > 10.

> Then change to Timsort in V8 v7.0 / Chrome 70.
>
> Finally it's all STABLE sorting now :)

#BinarySearchTree #BST

> #BinarySearchTree #BST
>
> The traversal ways of Binary Search Tree are Breadth First Tree Traversal(BFT) & Depth First Tree Traversal(DFT).
> There are 3 ways for DFT (PreOrder, InOrder, PostOrder)
>
> If you use InOrder way, you'll get the sorted result!
